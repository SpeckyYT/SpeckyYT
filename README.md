# SpeckyYT

You can also call me Specky ;)

I'm a hobbyist programmer and most of the things I do is for fun.

I live in Italy, speak 4 languages and I like cats.

# Programming

I started off at school learning the basics of C++ for Arduino. I really like the code-aspect of it, but I dislike having to work with physical stuff.
I am still making some Arduino projects with my brother to this day.

I also learned the basics of BASIC (middle 2019) and LUA (end 2019) for some game-engines, but nothing serious.

Around the end of 2019 I also started building SpeckyBot, a Discord Bot written in JavaScript.
To this day, JavaScript is the language I'm most comfortable with.

I also learned CoffeeScript, which I use from time to time (usually on SpeckyBot).

# Hot Stuff

- [SpeckyBot](https://github.com/SpeckyYT/SpeckyBot) AKA my personal dump of code
- [specky-endecode](https://github.com/SpeckyYT/specky-endecode) a text encrypter-decrypter which works two-ways (basically like an enigma machine)
- [good-censor](https://github.com/SpeckyYT/good-censor) a text-censoring module with lots of customizability
